## Overview
SpamScope is an advanced spam analysis tool that use [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) with [streamparse](https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse) to process a stream of mails. 

It's possible to analyze about 5 milions of mails (without Apache Tika analisys) for day with a 4 cores server and 4 GB of RAM. If you enable Apache Tika, you can analyze about 1 milion of mails.

### Distributed
SpamScope use Apache Storm that allows you to start small and scale horizontally as you grow. Simply add more worker.

### Flexibility
You can chose your mails input sources (with spouts) and your functionalities (with bolts). SpamScope come with a tokenizer (split mail in token: headers, body, attachments), attachments and phishing analyzer (Which is the target of mails? Is there a malware in attachment?) and JSON output.

### Store where you want
You can build your custom output bolts and store your data in Elasticsearch, Mongo, filesystem, etc.

### Build your topology
With streamparse tecnology you can build your topology in Python, add and/or remove spouts and bolts.

### Apache 2 Open Source License
SpamScope can be downloaded, used, and modified free of charge. It is available under the Apache 2 license.

## Installation
For more details please visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation).

Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope.git
```

Install requirements in file `requirements.txt` with `python-pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Faup
[Faup](https://github.com/stricaud/faup) stands for Finally An Url Parser and is a library and command line tool to parse URLs and normalize fields.
To install it follow the [wiki](https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation#faup).

### Tika (optional)
SpamScope can use [Tika App](https://tika.apache.org/) to parse every attachment mail.
The **Apache Tika** toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF).
To install it follow the [wiki](https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation#tika-app-optional).
To enable Apache Tika analisys, you should set it in `attachments` section.

### Thug (optional)
From release v1.3 SpamScope can analyze Javascript and HTML attachments with [Thug](https://github.com/buffer/thug).
If you want to analyze the attachments with Thug, follow [these instructions](http://buffer.github.io/thug/doc/build.html) to install it and enable it in `attachments` section.

What is Thug? From README project:
```
Thug is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicing the behavior of a web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.
```

You can see a complete SpamScope report with Thug analysis [here](https://goo.gl/Y4kWCv).

### VirusTotal (optional)
It's possible add to results (for mail attachments) VirusTotal report. You need a private API key.

### Elasticsearch (optional)
It's possible to store the results in Elasticsearch. In this case you should install `elasticsearch` package.

### Redis (optional)
It's possible to store the results in Redis. In this case you should install `redis` package.



## Configuration
For more details please visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Configuration) or read the comments in the files in `conf` folder.

From SpamScope v1.1 you can decide to **filter mails and attachments** already analyzed. If you enable filter in `tokenizer` section you will enable the RAM database and
SpamScope will check on it to decide if mail/attachment is already analyzed or not. If the mail is in RAM database, SpamScope will not analyze it and will store only the hashes.



## Usage
SpamScope comes with two topologies:
   - spamscope_debug
   - spamscope_elasticsearch
   - spamscope_redis

and a general configuration file `spamscope.example.yml` in `conf/` folder.


To run topology for debug:

```
sparse run --name topology
```

If you want submit topology to Apache Storm:

```
sparse submit -f --name topology
```

### Important
It's very important to set the main configuration file. The default value is `/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml`, but it's possible to set the environment variable `SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE`:

```
$ export SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE=/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml
```

If you use Elasticsearch output, I suggest you to use Elasticsearch template that comes with SpamScope.

### Apache Storm settings
It's possible change the default settings for all Apache Storm options. I suggest for SpamScope these options:

 - **topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs**: reload configuration of all bolts
 - **topology.max.spout.pending**: Apache Storm framework will then throttle your spout as needed to meet the `topology.max.spout.pending` requirement
 - **topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms**: max sleep for emit new tuple (mail)

If you don't enable Apache Tika, Thug and VirusTotal, could use:

```
topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs: 60
topology.max.spout.pending: 200
topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms: 10
```

If **Apache Tika** is enabled:

```
topology.max.spout.pending: 100
```

To submit above options use:

```
sparse submit -f --name topology -o "topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs=60" -o "topology.max.spout.pending=100" -o "topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms=10"
```

**Thug** analysis can be very slow, it depends from attachment. To avoid Apache Storm timeout, you should use these two switches when submit the topology:

```
supervisor.worker.timeout.secs=600
topology.message.timeout.secs=600
```

As you can see, the timeouts are both to 600 seconds. 600 seconds is the default timeout of Thug. 

The complete command is:
```
sparse submit -f --name topology -o "topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs=60" -o "topology.max.spout.pending=50" -o "topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms=10" -o "supervisor.worker.timeout.secs=600" -o "topology.message.timeout.secs=600"
```
